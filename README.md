# üåç Global Terrorism Database Analysis

## üìÅ Project Overview
Terrorism remains one of the most pressing global challenges, with incidents often going unattributed due to the absence of claims from perpetrator groups. This project leverages the Global Terrorism Database (1970‚Äì2021) ‚Äî a rich dataset with over 214,000 incidents and 135 attributes ‚Äî to build machine learning models that predict the terrorist group (gname) responsible for an attack, based on incident characteristics.
This project explores the [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) to understand patterns, trends, and insights from terrorist incidents worldwide. The analysis covers data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning models to classify or predict the type of attack.
Our primary goal is to explore the potential of data-driven methods in supporting faster investigations, better resource allocation, and enhanced counter-terrorism strategies.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

The project uses the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**, publicly available for research.
Some important columns include:

* **`gname` (Target Variable)** ‚Üí Terrorist group name responsible for the attack.
* **`country_txt`** ‚Üí Country where the incident took place.
* **`attacktype1_txt`** ‚Üí Type of attack (e.g., Bombing, Armed Assault, Assassination).
* **`targtype1_txt`** ‚Üí Primary target type (e.g., Military, Police, Private Citizens, Business).
* **`weaptype1_txt`** ‚Üí Type of weapon used.
* **`region_txt`** ‚Üí Geographical region of the incident.
* **`nkill`** ‚Üí Number of people killed.
* **`nwound`** ‚Üí Number of people wounded.
* **Other features** such as year, month, success of attack, suicide indicator, etc.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed extensive **data exploration and visualization** to identify key insights, including:

* Trends of terrorist attacks over time.
* Most targeted countries, regions, and sectors.
* Common attack types and weapon types.
* Correlation of features with the target variable (`gname`).
* Handling of **missing values**, **class imbalance**, and **noisy data**.

Color maps like `viridis`, `plasma`, and `RdBu` were used for clear and impressive visualizations.
